Next steps
•	Prune unused features: Drop weekly_touch and retrain to simplify your model.
•	Enhance weekly signals: If you still want multi-timeframe inputs, try things like weekly RSI or weekly MACD rather than a binary flag.
•	Cross-ticker comparison: Repeat this analysis for a handful of other symbols—do the same features dominate, or does the hierarchy shift?
•	Feature interaction: Explore combining features (e.g. RSI × dist_pct) to capture non-linear effects.
